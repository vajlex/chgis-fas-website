------------------

Toponymic information is based on the Geographic Names Data Base,
containing official standard names approved by the United States Board on 
Geographic Names and maintained by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.
More information is available at the Maps and Geodata link at www.nga.mil.

CHGIS Editor's Note:  Chinese Placenames in GNS files were extracted from 
numerous map sources.  Romanizations are mixed (Pinyin, Wade-Giles, ad hoc).
Hierarchical Administrative Unit information, found in all of the FIELDS to 
the right of NM_ASCII (in the attribute table) are derived from spatial joins
with COUNTY level units, circa 1991, and match the National Standard Codes
(GuoBiao Codes) in the publication GBT / 2260 1991.  Therefore the data can be
sorted by Prefectural Level Unit (using the PREF_ID field) or by County Level
Unit (using the CNTY_ID field).  A digital table of the GBT 2260 codes can be
downloaded from CHGIS.
